			<h2>Big 7 Agenda 2023/24</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Effective Administration:</strong>Anthony is an experienced policy maker and leader who believes that each executive member is responsible for their election. Implementing a system that clearly defines the roles of each executive member runs a long way with our constitution. By an act of the Executive , having three Mulesa Executive Committees;
				<ul type="square">
				  <li><strong>Mulesa Events Committee</strong></li>
				  [Organising Sec, Treasurer,Vice Sec Gen,Year 4,3,2,1]
				  <li><strong>Mulesa County/Bursary Committee</strong></li> [Vice Chairperson, 3 County reps]
				  <li><strong>Mulesa Special Delegation Committee</strong></li> [Chairperson,Sec Gen,4th Year , 2 or 4 Members]
				  <li><strong>Independent Advisory office of the Fouth Year</strong></li>
				</ul>
				will foster culture collaboration and shared decision making that will promote efficiency and responsibility.</li>
				<li><strong>Enhance Academic Support:</strong> We will foster and promote student-led initiatives, clubs, support talents (e.g sports),study groups, hobbies, mentorship programs and all academic interests as best as possible.</li>
				<li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> We will expand member involvement in decision making , consultation and suggestions on initiatives establishment to create sense of belonging and service.</li>
				<li><strong>Fostering Diversity and Inclusion:</strong> We will hold well organized cultural events,hikes and members engagement events in the most transparent manner ever. We believe that a set up Events Committee will promote direct involvement in opinion abstraction.</li>
				<li><strong>Embracing Digitization and Technological Advancement:</strong>Recognizing the transformative power of technology and academics, we remain positive to lead MULESA towards a more digitized and advanced future. Some of the digital tools we believe will streamline our welfare will include, A digital Register to keep member participation records , dully functional Website, Digital voter register Among others.</li>
				<li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Best acts of Executive will cusion respect and trust of executive from its members. We believe that propers documented records,minutes , regular reports and updates to the members will ensure transparency. A more open channel of questioning and feedback from the executive will run a long way with trust and accountability. </li>
				<li><strong>Strengthening our Welfare:</strong> A more vocal and student handbook adherence association is the best we can wish for. Collaboration with other houses ensures friendly coexistence and family belonging.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Vice Chairperson</h3>
			<p>Dear Members,<br>We are rich people, blessed with diversity and talent.
In this moment of our story of building Mulesa
we want, we have before us a grand opportunity.An opportunity as the great people of our country, to 
join hands and make what will hopefully be a lasting contribution to uplifting our lives,to advancing our common interests , and to add to the abundance of our academic world.
We have an opportunity to animate the intentions that underpin our social contract as a people. An opportunity to enrich the quality of life of every member, and to ensure that every member of our great 
association enjoys the rights, privileges and benefits of belonging.
We are at a delicate moment of our history, a moment that calls for leadership that is people centered, a leadership that views things with a social justice lens. 
It is a moment that calls for leaders with a shared history of fighting for the rights of the people, for democracy and the rule of law, leaders with a shared history of sacrifice and servant leadership to band together once again to advance the collective agenda of our land.

			  <h2>Achievements</h2>
			  	<ul>
			  	  <li><strong>Logo :</strong>Thou not holding a powerful position, One of the Greatest achievement since I joined our association last Year was successful transition to a new customized logo that maintained high standards of awareness and identity.</li>
			  	  <li><strong>Publication press: </strong> At all time my printer was used by the offices of our Secretary General and that of Chairperson to provide Posters and documentation whenever the office required. We gave these Services at the best of our standards and free of charge. </li>
			  	  <li><strong>Truthful matters: </strong>
			  	    I strongly stood up for the members whenever ill debates and bad leadership tried to wreck down our unity. I protected public funds from embezzlement by rogue cartels to the best of my capabilities with available powers as a second year Representative. I always remained committed to stepping aside of illegitimate leaders.</li>
			  	  <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> Being a firm policy maker and an editor , i still believe in a strong constitution that bides each and every member willingly and lawfully equal.</li>
